# interview-project
Hi :-)
I hope I did everything ok git-wise. If not, please let me know.
This exercise was fun. I had little experience with several topics related to it, and I feel I've learned a lot, which is what I'm looking for. So regardless of the outcome,
thanks for the opportunity.
It was also very big (or maybe it just felt that way because I had to learn some things from scratch) and unfortuntately there is just one thing I just didn't manage to
add in time - which is the JWT authentication. A little bit more time would have been enough, but I had already asked for an additional day because I was sick, so I
didn't wanna ask again.

A few remarks and assumption I made for simplicity:
- I assume only one user can be logged in at the same time
- I really wasn't sure how I want to reflect the fact that a certain user is already logged in. So I ended up just saving it in memory. This is not ideal, and I'm aware
of it, but I didn't want to waste too much time on that because I was short anyway.
- Most of the code is in bot.py and views,py
- I start the server everytime with "python manage.py runserver" command
- Everytime the server starts, both tables of the DB get cleared (db.sqlite3)
- If endpoints URLs we're un-ideally designed, again, this is due to the time pressure (I wanted the main features to work) so sorry in advance.

Thank you!
